PREFACE: As a TA, I'm going to mark against the Sprint 1 rubric here: https://cmsweb.utsc.utoronto.ca/cscc01f20/project/Sprint1_marking.txt.
As long as you follow the rubric, you'll be fine.

Q: Do I complete the architecture design and CRC cards before I start coding?
A: Ideally you should. Example: https://github.com/brian1999lin/cscc01-tut0004/blob/master/tut2/final-project-example/example-system-design.docx

Q: Do I need to make a standup channel to post our progress for marks?
A: Per the rubric, you need a channel named #standup. CTRL+F "Daily Stand-ups". *Everyone* needs to post their status.

Q: When is Sprint 1?
A: Officially, it starts when the Sprint 1 planning meeting ends (Oct. 8), and Sprint 1 ends (Oct. 23).

Q: When do we notify you about standups?
A: Ping me every time you start a standup.

Q: How do we name our branches? How do we do PRs?
A: I covered this in our first tutorial. Watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYwWf3ocMBs
BE SURE TO READ THE RUBRIC AS IT COVERS WHAT IS EXPECTED!

A quick refresher of the general idea:
1. Pick a task from the JIRA board.
2. Branch off master using the syntax USERNAME/JIRA-TASK-HERE as your branch name.
3. Continue committing to this branch until you're finished with the feature.
4. Merge master into the feature branch so that the branch is updated.
5. Create a pull request with a detailed description of what is in the commit.
6. Have someone review the code, and when it's ready, "Squash and merge" the commit into master, deleting the branch after it's merged.
7. Update JIRA.
